The Website Usage Tracker Chrome Extension helps users monitor their browsing habits by tracking total and daily website usage. Inspired by Android's Digital Wellbeing, this extension provides insights into screen time and allows users to set timers or block specific websites for better productivity and digital wellbeing.


## Features

**Total Usage Tracking**: Monitor total time spent on websites, similar to steam game tracking total hours

**Daily Reports**: View detailed usage statistics day by day.

**Site Timers**: Set time limits for specific websites.

**Website Blocking**: Restrict access to certain websites after the time limit is reached.

**Variety of Themes**: A variety of default color themes are offered with the ability to generate your own themes.

**User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive UI for easy tracking and management.


## Installation
This extension is now available on the chrome web store! Feel free to easily install it from there. However, for features as they roll out, or if you would like to make your own changes, feel free to follow these instructions to install it locally. 

1. Download or clone this repository.

2. Type npm install in project directory.

3. Type npm run build to build the dist folder (requires npm). 

4. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.

5. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right corner).

6. Click "Load unpacked" and select the dist folder in the project directory.

The extension will now be installed and visible in your toolbar.

At a later point I will upload the extension to the chrome webstore.


## Future Enhancements

**Sync Across Devices**: Store data in Chrome Sync for multi-device tracking.

**Customizable Alerts**: Notifications before reaching limits.

**Category-Based Limits**: Restrict entire categories (e.g., social media, news).

**Full Website Tracking**: Right now tracking only follows websites that you choose, but a future setting to allow tracking of all website usage is in progress.
