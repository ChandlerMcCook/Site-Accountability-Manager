# Site Accountability Manager

## Overview

The Website Usage Tracker Chrome Extension helps users monitor their browsing habits by tracking total, daily, and monthly website usage. Inspired by Android's Digital Wellbeing, this extension provides insights into screen time and allows users to set timers or block specific websites for better productivity and digital wellbeing.


## Features

**Total Usage Tracking**: Monitor total time spent on websites, similar to steam game tracking total hours

**Daily & Monthly Reports**: View detailed usage statistics over time.

**Site Timers**: Set time limits for specific websites.

**Website Blocking**: Restrict access to certain websites after the time limit is reached.

**User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive UI for easy tracking and management.


## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.

2. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.

3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right corner).

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder.

The extension will now be installed and visible in your toolbar.

## Future Enhancements

**Sync Across Devices**: Store data in Chrome Sync for multi-device tracking.

**Customizable Alerts**: Notifications before reaching limits.

**Category-Based Limits**: Restrict entire categories (e.g., social media, news).

**Dark Mode Support**
